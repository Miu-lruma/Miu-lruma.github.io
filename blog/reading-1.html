		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Hi! I am Randall Krueger, a junior at the University of Notre Dame, majoring in computer science. I will graduate in 2019 with a bachelor of science degree in engineering.</p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;I've loved computers and working with the freedom that they give the developer since I was a young teenager. The first programming I ever attempted was modifying Ruby code for my favorite PC video game when I was 11 years old, <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic" target="_blank">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</a> When I saw that I could write lines of text that would completely change the way the game ran, I was hooked. Now, I'm proficient in C++, C, Python, and I am currently spending my free time studying JavaScript, so that I can add it to the list. I've used a multitude of other languages, programs, and services, most of which are documented on my resume, which you can find on the <a href="http://Viice.github.io" target="_blank">home page of my website.</a> Now, I guess, I need to stop stealing from the original “about me” section of my website and write something unique to ethics...</p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;My interests outside of school are still related to my major. I love working with computers, modifying any and all settings in order to make my computer as personalized and optimized as it can be. I am also very interested in <a href="%E2%80%9Dhttp://blog.counter-strike.net/%E2%80%9D">Counter Strike: Global Offensive</a>; I was invited to play professionally the summer before I began attending Notre Dame, but passed up the opportunity in order to come to school here. Now that I have been at Notre Dame for a few years, I founded a club on campus for the game. This will be our first active semester, and I plan to have an official team for our school along with a workshop to teach new players techniques and tactics that they may not already know.</p>

				<p>&emsp;&emsp;What I want to get out of this class the most is good discussions. I want to interact with my peers and have in-depth conversation about computer science and the ethical issues that are related to the field. It is not common to be in a room with so many people who are as intelligent or as interested in computer science and the surrounding issues, and I likely won’t have an opportunity like I do here at Notre Dame to have these interactions; so I am looking forward to doing so in this class.</p>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;Some of the most pressing ethical issues related to computer science include the dilemmas pertaining to security vs. privacy, the morality of hacking another country or individual if it will help save the lives of people, and the ethics relating to the creation of potentially dangerous AI. Out of all of these issues, the most interesting issue in my opinion is the issue regarding AI. The creation of such an AI is the way of the future, and this moral dilemma is one of the most important ones facing humanity in the future. Surely, we can create an AI capable of both great and terrible things. But should we?</p>
