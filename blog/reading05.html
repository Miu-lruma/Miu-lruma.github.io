		Reading 05: The Responsibility to Prevent Errors
	</div>

		<p>&emsp;&emsp;The Therac-25 accidents were a series of incidents in which patients that required radiation treatment were administered a much higher dosage than required, resulting in injury and death.  The incidents occurred when magnets used to spread a radiation beam were not engaged in combination with a higher power beam than desired being used.  These mistakes ended up in a powerful beam being directly administered to one part of the body, causing burns and in some cases death.  There were three main errors in the software.  The first being a race condition, in which the machine would accept input during the 8 second magnet setting phase, with a variable used by both the magnet setter and the keyboard input being overwritten by the magnet setting phase if the keyboard input is completed fast enough.  A second error in the Therac-25 software was an issue involving byte overflow in a shared variable, in which a setup code was run many times, incrementing a variable each time.  If this code was executed 256 times, the variable would revert to 0, and if the operator set the program to execute at this exact time, the high-power beam would be used, and the patient would be injured.  The third issue had to do with user error.  If the operator input an ‘x’ instead of an ‘e’ in the input, again, the high dose would be administered to the patient.  While this is user error, the program should detect this error and inform the administrator.  In the case of the Therac-25, however, an error number was the only thing reported, and the administrator ignored this error message because she did not know what it meant. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;When working on safety-critical systems, like the Therac-25, one thing that is very important to do is test.  The FDA determined that AECL had not formally tested their software for Therac-25, and without these formal rigorous tests, these errors relating to the race condition and byte overflow were able to slip through.  If this was software for a game, or something else that is less critical, the company could release a patch without serious damage.  When your software is dealing with lives, however, you need to be absolutely certain that the software will not fail.  Another possibility would be to add in extra error checking: an error message more elaborate than a number would help the administrator to understand what is wrong with their input and fix the mistake before ending someone’s life.  Hardware error checking would also be a good addition, as the software would then not be able to issue a fatal dose of radiation to a patient – instead the beam would refuse to fire without the magnetic scattering, for example.  When dealing with software that deals with the lives of patients, safety should come first, and issues like this should never slip through.  The software developers AND the people who administered the radiation should be held liable for their part in the death of these patients.  This sort of error is unacceptable. </p>
