		Reading 07: The Invasive Advertisements
	</div>
	<div class="viice-content viice-container" id="about">
		<p class="viice-center"></p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;There are many instances in which I have seen options to opt out of data collection for ads specialized to me.  I always take these options, as for one, the option always sounds pretentious, asking something like “Allow us to serve you specialized ads that you’ll like better ”, and second, I want as little of my data out there as possible.  Seeing these options makes me uneasy that the companies that many people trust desire to collect and sell data relating to them, but also pleased that they at least give people the option to opt out if the user looks for it.  I find this collection ethical if the opt-out option completely disabled the data collection, as they are allowing the users the choice to have their data collected or not.  If a company collects and sells data without giving the user a choice, or allows them to choose “less” data collection, which is barely less at all, I feel this is much worse than before, but still ethical.  As long as the user knows their data is being collected, it is their choice to continue to use the service.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Many more companies will collect data about you, not to sell, but to predict what you will soon do related to their company.  A famous example of this is when Target sent pregnancy advertisements to a girl who’s family did not know she was pregnant.  Target was able to do this because they collected purchase data about the customer, and realized that she was purchasing items that pregnant women generally purchase.  This purchase surveillance is significantly less unnerving than other cloud computing devices like Alexa or the Barbie doll that records the voices of its users to send to a computer somewhere for voice recognition.  There’s nothing stopping the companies from recording the voices of its users or noises in the background that could potentially reveal a lot more information about the customer or capture things that were never meant to be captured.  If we are doing this with voice, how long before there’s an always-on camera in your fridge that recognizes when you’re waving at it so it can serve you a glass of water?  How long until you are giving people free vision into all rooms of your house?  I love privacy, but I can’t see people in general having much privacy as time goes on. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, with respect to online advertisement, it is very invasive.  You look at something on a webpage, next thing you see, it’s being advertised to you everywhere.  I have even encountered situations where I was talking to friends about something and soon saw online advertisements about the same item.  I hope, in the last case, that this was coincidence, and not our voices being monitored for advertisement purposes.  At this point, I do use adblock, because ads can be so invasive that they take up the entire page or make you wait for half a minute to watch a YouTube video that is shorter than the ad, itself.  I do think that it is unethical to block these ads, as it is like taking the product without selling your ad views for it, but I can’t bring myself to stop using adblock.  Some advertisers are much too invasive  and too distracting, and to avoid these few, I block them all. </p>
