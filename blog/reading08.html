		Reading 08: The Muslim Registry
	</div>
	<div class="viice-content viice-container" id="about">
		<p class="viice-center"></p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Corporate personhood is the concept of allowing a corporation to enjoy some of the same rights given to individuals within the United States, such as the ability to sue or be sued.  As such, corporations are able to enjoy protection under the law from things such as search and seizure or double jeopardy.  However, corporations cannot die or be put in jail, and as such, enjoy the benefits of being a person without some of the pitfalls, at least with regard to the legal system. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;In the tech world, there are some issues that many engineers feel are immoral.  Today, one such issue is the idea of the Muslim Registry.  Many engineers and tech companies have pledged not to provide information on people based on religious beliefs or build technology that will collect such data for the United States government – perhaps they read articles on IBM and the Holocaust.  While I feel like it is immoral to discriminate against people based on features such as religion, do I think that this pledge is worth taking?  Not really – while the idea is to prevent the government from acquiring such technology, a handful of Silicon Valley executives and software developers promising not to act and promising to inform the public and quit their job if their company takes part in developing this technology will not stop the United States government from acquiring this technology if they so desire.  It would be nearly impossible to get every software engineer to sign this pledge, and even if you were able to get every employee in Silicon Valley to agree, this still wouldn’t be enough.  The United States government has enough money to change the mind of some greedy engineers, and this isn’t even considering the government’s own software developers or outsourcing the project to another country that cares less for ethics and the lives of American Muslims than the software engineers here in the United States.    So with respect to the companies here, I respect the decision not to participate in creating the registry, but I don’t think that saying “no” will realistically change anything.  As to who decides what is right and wrong for a company, I would say that this falls in the hands of the top executives of the companies.  Sure, workers can quit, or individual leaders can take a stand against their superiors, but I think that this would lead to them being easily replaced and for the project to continue as planned, but with the moral engineer out of a job.  For the company as a whole to take a stand, the top leader will have to say that they will not act and they will not tolerate any of their subordinates acting. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;As far as corporate personhood and ethics goes, I would say that yes, a company should be held to the same moral obligations that any person is held to – which is none at all.  Companies and people are held accountable to the law, and for the most part, to the same degree, with the exception being the kind of punishment they face.  If a company were to somehow conspire to murder someone, there would be a huge scandal, and the company would very likely shut down, or suffer to the point of becoming irrelevant.  But this is because of the law against murder.  There is no law that says you cannot build a database of information about people based on religion.  There is nothing stopping me or you from creating this, and likewise, there should be nothing stopping a company from doing the same, save the morality of its leaders who don’t want to take part in a discriminatory act. </p>
