		Reading 11: The Lack of Jobs

		<p>&emsp;&emsp;No, the Luddites are wrong.  It’s a ludicrous idea to halt development in order to save certain jobs.  Technological advancement is what brings humanity to higher and higher levels.  There should be no such legal restriction on anything.  The biggest exception that could be argued is militaristic advancement, but even that should be unregulated.  While human lives may be in danger, no government would be able to be an aggressor without being held accountable by other nations.  Thinking to the future – these weapons may even save us from a greater threat.  As far as everyday technologies, however, this is not even an issue.  If people in the past had thought the same thing about, let’s say, the car putting those who work with horses out of business, we would all be significantly less well-off.  Following the same logic, those who worked with horses may have lost jobs, but instead of suddenly losing their profession, the advancement of the car led the next generation to study the working of automobiles rather than working with horses, and those who were currently employed with horses were able to continue their jobs until they were able to retire, as the switch was not instant.  Similarly, any current advancement would be gradual, and the new advancements would bring a new wave of jobs to the market – even ones regarding the creation of the artificial intelligence that could take over jobs in factories or at fast food restaurants.  A universal basic income is a nice idea in theory, but providing enough money for everyone to live on is much more than any government could afford.  It is true that there will be a loss of many unskilled labor positions.  While it would be ideal that there are more and more positions in technological fields that open up to people, there are many people who do not have the skill or desire to enter these fields, and with a lack of unskilled positions, there will not be many places for these people to work.  I am honestly not sure what the best approach to this problem would be.  Perhaps the best option is to offer better training for skilled work, but even taking that route, skilled jobs are already oversaturated.  Maybe laborers can be hired to move to less technologically advanced places in the world to bring advances there, too – but who would pay for it?  This is a question I do not have the perfect answer to.  I do know, however, that the world is very overpopulated, and would definitely be better off with some sort of population control, but that is another ethical issue for another day.  </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Ultimately, I am in favor or as much artificial intelligence, automation, and technological advancement as possible.  <a href=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/12/a_i_neural_photo_and_image_style_transfer_will_change_the_art_world.html>Artificial intelligence is already capable of creating amazing artistic works</a>, and when people are able to create machines capable of doing the other human activities, I will wholeheartedly trust them more than I trust other people.  Imagine seeing two circles, one drawn by a machine and one by a human.  If you are asked to judge which is drawn by the human, you will choose the one with more imperfections – more mistakes. </p>
