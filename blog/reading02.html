		Reading 02: The Interview

		<p>&emsp;&emsp;My job interview process has yet to begin, but I’ve finished my internship interview process.  I will be interning with Epic Systems in Madison, Wisconsin this summer.  My interview process was very smooth, which surprised me, based on what I’ve heard from others who have gone through the process.  Most of the events that related to the interview process were very harmless, informational conversations about life at the company, that were not hard “grilling” of my knowledge of computer science.  The two exceptions to this were a short interview in which I described a project I have previously worked on and an online assessment with three sections.  This online assessment was my least favorite part of the process, but likely the most useful for the company.  The assessment lasted roughly three hours, and consisted of three sections, including a math section and a coding section.  These were the most frustrating sections of the process.  During the math section, I was asked to solve ten questions in two minutes, and I was not allowed a calculator.  I was able to get most of the questions, but there were a couple of questions that involved 4-digit multiplication, which I was unable to quickly do in my head.  I later learned that other applicants were allowed a calculator for this section.  Frustrating.  The coding section was also frustrating to me, as I was asked to write code without online resources or the option to test my code to see what is generated.  In general, I will be able to test my code as I write it.  Despite these complications, I was offered the internship, so I must have written some good code.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;The general interview process is smooth, but it has some issued.  For one, my interviews with Epic Systems were in October and November; I received my offer and was expected to make a decision while I was still in the early stages of interviewing with other companies, including Amazon.  If I had wanted to go to Amazon, I would have either had to tell Epic to wait, somehow try to accept their offer and then back out if I received an offer from Amazon, or tell Epic no, in hopes that I will get an offer from Amazon, being out of luck if not.  This irregularity in the process leads to decisions that could be considered ethics questions, as most people would agree that it would be morally wrong to tell Epic that I would intern with them, just to have a backup plan if I was not accepted at Amazon.  There are positives to the current system, however, as events like the career fair really make the process easier, providing useful information about the companies that are hiring, and also allowing students to submit resumes to get the word out to companies that might be interested. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;For a college student that already has the amount of work that we had to do, *cough* systems programming *cough* worrying about getting an internship, preparing for interviews, and planning to travel to on-site interviews can take up a lot of time; especially if you add in the ethical questions regarding dealing with one employer that has given you an offer while waiting for an offer from another. </p>
