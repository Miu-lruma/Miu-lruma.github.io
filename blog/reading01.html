		Reading 01: The Hacker
	</div>
	<div class="viice-content viice-container" id="about">
		<p class="viice-center"></p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;I have to start this entry off with discussion of the reading of “A Portrait of J. Random Hacker.”  As I look through this paper, under each section, I feel like they cannot continue to describe me, and yet… each part I read, I find myself being able to say “yeah, that sounds like me, all right.”  Even statements as simple as stating that the only team sport enjoyed by hackers is volleyball – the only team sport I played throughout school, save competitive gaming.  The article nails my education, my religion, my dress, my politics, and even my favorite foods.  This could easily be a portrait of me.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;While I match the archetype of a hacker in basic lifestyle choices, like food and sports, there is a lot more that makes a hacker.  In the manifesto, The Mentor talks about the idea of knowing the other hackers on the Internet without ever meeting them or talking to them; there is no skin color, nationality, or religion.  The hacker relates to other hackers without knowing one another, this camaraderie is a key trait of the hacker archetype.  Another aspect of the archetype is that of curiosity.  In the manifesto, The Mentor mentions that his crime is that of curiosity, and this relates to Draper and the phone phreakers.  Draper stated that he was “mostly interested in the curiosity of how the phone company worked.  I had no real desire to rip them off and steal phone service.”  I definitely relate to this attribute of curiosity.  Like I mentioned in my “about me” section, I initially became interested in      coding and computer science because of my interest in modifying video games to see what kind of effects I can have on the program.  It is this desire to modify and see the change is what gives me the curiosity of a hacker.  For example, if I were to see a door left ajar in one of the engineering buildings, I will have curiosity that leads me to enter the room and look around, but without the malicious intent that would lead me to take something or damage the property of others.  Is this ethical? I’m not entirely sure – but as long as none of the objects in the room are touched or damaged, I would personally argue that it’s okay.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;While the general stigma against hackers as malicious individuals who attack others for fun or for personal gain through the Internet and they are generally regarded as criminals, the archetypes outlined by the various articles tries to stray from the idea of hackers being criminals and malicious.  Hackers are more defined by their curiosity, their love of the Internet, and their personality traits.  Do I identify with the hacker archetype?  To an extent – yeah, I think I do.  I love the ideas behind their curiosity and the non-conformist attitude, and yet the commonplace archetype of the hacker is also based in truth, some hackers definitely do fit the malicious criminal profile, and I don’t associate with that school of thought.  Is there such a thing as a self-identified ethical hacker?  I think I’m that.  I mean... I like Chinese food, after all.</p>
