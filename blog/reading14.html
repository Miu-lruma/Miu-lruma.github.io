		Reading 14: The Shape of Computer Science

		<p>&emsp;&emsp; “University computer science departments are in miserable shape: 10 years behind in a field that changes every 10 minutes.”  Says a writer for the Wall Street Journal.  I couldn’t agree more.  While there are many good courses offered here at Notre Dame, I found that many of the courses that I feel I learn the most from are electives.  The core curriculum of our computer science department is lacking, in my opinion.  It may have changed since I took the courses, so I will speak from my own experience.  My first coding here was in LabView and MatLab in Intro Engineering.  MatLab has its uses, but it is definitely not the core programming experience that I think we want or need.  LabView I think has no place in a college course.  I learned a bit about OOP in Data Structures, and I learned the majority of what I know in Systems Programming.  While it was challenging, I learned several new languages, how to work with shell scripts, command line arguments, multiprocessing, and even many customization things that have helped me until today through guru points.  Nothing has been more practical or helpful while I’ve been here at Notre Dame.  Theory offered a look at how Turing machines can simulate everything up to the high level programs we have today and OS gave a look into the inner workings of the parts of the computer that most people never see.  Then, we have some of the other courses… The only thing I took away from discrete math is the concept of big O notation, something we already covered in Systems Programming in a day.  Logic Design and Computer Architecture seemed useful for computer engineers, but the discussion of Verilog, wires, and assembly has not helped me in becoming a software engineer, unless for some reason I decide to build a compiler.  Even OS and Theory taught me more about what goes on behind the scenes rather than the application of concepts that I will likely use in a career.  I came to college to learn to be a software developer, and yet I feel that I learn more in spending a day or two on a personal project than I do spending an entire semester on some classes.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;The university’s curriculum might match the gruelingly long guidelines from the ACM and the ABET criteria, in providing students a knowledge in how computers work behind the scenes and the theories behind how to build one from wires and switches, with a bit of programming, but that’s not necessarily what I want.  I know I am majoring in computer science, but there is no real “programming major”.  I have taken as many programming electives as possible, including fantastic courses like programming challenges and computer networks, yet I still find myself Googling to find the answers to how to work with the most basic standard libraries in C++ and Python – something I really wish I had learned on the first day of class – maybe I should have just gone to bootcamp. </p>
