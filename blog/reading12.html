		Reading 12: The Autonomous Vehicle
	</div>
	<div class="viice-content viice-container" id="about">
		<p class="viice-center"></p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Self-driving cars will be more common than human-driven cars.  The technology that “drives” these autonomous vehicles is already strong enough to follow rules of the road, steer, and avoid obstacles – for the most part.  Despite autonomous vehicles being the way of the future, there are people who are arguing over whether or not they are a good idea.  The biggest arguments are whether or not autonomous cars can accurately see what is in front of them and properly react, and whether or not autonomous cars will be able to accurately judge human behavior.   The first argument, I feel to be almost a non-point.  While this technology is not currently perfect, it exists.  As time goes on, this technology will get better and better, and when combined with the split-second reactions of a computer, the reactions of autonomous cars to an event such as someone jumping out in front of the car will be much faster than that of a human driver.  However, in this same scenario, a human drier may be able to recognize that the pedestrian is planning on jumping in front of the car, and slow down even before the person jumps.  This is the greatest argument for human drivers.  I would argue that as technology improves, likely autonomous cars will be able to recognize this intent and have such quick reactions that they will be able to stop in time.  In their current state, autonomous cars would likely cause more accidents than current human drivers, but in the future, when these technologies have improved, and especially if it was possible to have only autonomous cars, these machines will make the roads a lot safer – for one, robots cannot get drunk. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;There is disagreement over what autonomous cars should do in certain situations.  For example, <a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/">there is an entire website dedicated to determining what is the moral outcome of certain situations that an autonomous car might encounter.</a>  Looking at this, you will quickly see that in some situations, most people agree that the self-driving car should crash, killing its driver, to save the lives of many.  In the linked gizmodo article, the author states that while this is what most people agree on, they would not like to ride in these cars – likewise, if they were driving, they would likely hit the people to save themselves.  This is the selfishness of humans.  If autonomous cars were exclusively driven, casualties would decline, and people would have to accept that risk if they want to ride in their self-driving cars.  This is where, ultimately, the government should intervene.  Once the software on self-driving cars is strong enough to save lives, they should have exclusivity of the roads.  This would eliminate the selfishness of humans as well as the need for autonomous cars to predict stupid actions of human drivers.  Once autonomous cars have strong enough technology to recognize and avoid danger, I will definitely purchase one.  Today, we are in prototype phases, and the few crashes that occur are just part of the testing process.  The people who agree to ride in the cars and neglect to watch the roads, themselves, know the risks they are taking – every technology needs to be tested before it is perfected. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Driving is a chore that we should not have to deal with anymore!  The more people that have them, the better.  Again – I would trust a machine over a human in a heartbeat. </p>
