		Reading 06: The Snowden Case
	</div>
	<div class="viice-content viice-container" id="about">
		<p class="viice-center"></p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Edward Snowden is one of the more controversial figures in modern American politics.  In 2013, Snowden leaked a lot of information from the United States government, primarily the National Security Agency, or the NSA.  The leaks contained information that outlined many intrusive actions of the NSA, including the fact that the NSA has been collecting phone records from American Citizens, user data from websites like Google and Facebook, and over 200 million text messages every day.  In addition to data collection, the public learned about the phone tapping of world leaders including Angela Merkel, the ability of the NSA to infiltrate Google’s data centers, and a secret elite hacker team that had the ability to hack into computers worldwide, known as the TAO.  Snowden was able to acquire this information with a few flash drives and the knowledge required to infiltrate an outdated computer system. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;As to whether or not what Snowden did is ethical, things get more complicated.  In terms of following a code of ethics, revealing secrets that you promised not to share is not morally right.  In this situation, however, I would argue that to an extent Snowden did the right thing by informing the public about the actions of the NSA.  Today, some of the more worrisome issues that face our society are oppressive governments that monitor and control the lives of their citizens.  Snowden exposed some unethical actions of the NSA, including the collection of text messages and the infiltration of Google’s data centers without informing anyone of these intrusions.  Snowden’s actions led to good outcomes in these cases, with Google and other tech companies strengthening their security systems and laws being passed to make the relationship between the government and the phone companies that were supplying records more transparent and less intrusive.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;While there were benefits to the American society because of Snowden’s whistleblowing, there were also some drawbacks.  Not all of the documents leaked by Snowden pertain to these big-ticket unethical actions taken by the NSA.  Much of the information that Snowden leaked did not have anything to do with invasive actions by the government, and instead had to do with the United States military and defense, giving away plans and tactics of the United States to enemies.  These documents don’t expose unethical practices, just threaten security.  While I, personally, thank that Snowden did the right thing by releasing some of the documents, I don’t think that he should have released all of them to the general public.  I think he was morally in the right by telling people about some of the practices, especially ones that related to the NSA, but I don’t think that he should be pardoned.  Snowden was brave in doing what he did, and I think that he set a good example for individuals who are aware of similar things and are unsure whether or not to inform the public.  However, this does not excuse the fact that he released a lot more than necessary, releasing information that was detrimental to the safety of the United States.  Snowden broke laws, and should not be allowed to come back to the United States, but there should not be some sort of witch hunt to find him. </p>
