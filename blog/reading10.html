		Reading 10: The Cyberbully

		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Having been an avid internet user for years, I have been exposed to both trolling and cyberbullying.  To me, they are two very different things.  Trolling is commonplace on the internet and consists of posting something that is childish, misleading, or annoying to mess with other users for a laugh.  Trolling can be hurtful or targeted, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVWejDSioAc"> like many of the examples in this video</a>, but once these attacks become repeatedly directed at one individual, especially when the targeted individual is no longer anonymous.  This is one of the reasons that I don’t like real name policies online.  The only services – outside of school accounts – that I use my real name for are LinkedIn, which I don’t really use other than to link to on my resume, and Facebook, which I regret.  Even with my real name on Facebook, I did not even have a picture of myself on the website until this year – I only use it to respond to events and to message people.  I think requiring real names is a good idea in theory, as people would be less likely to be mean with their name attached to their online activity, but often people can find a way around it, and it allows those who do use their real names to be even more of a target for cyberbullying.  If anonymity is used, someone being bullied can remove their account and essentially not be found.  </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Cyberbullying is an issue with the prevalence of social media today.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbully_(2011_film)">We all watched that one movie</a>, and we’ve all seen it.  Especially with children using technology earlier and earlier, some may not be able to escape bullying even when at home.  That being said, people related to those being cyberbullied should be doing something when this is seen online.  Whether this means that teachers and parents regularly look at their children’s Facebook profiles or classmates stand up for one another, I would prefer this method than having it be the technology company’s responsibility.  Freedom of speech should mean that people are allowed to say whatever they want; there may be consequences, but the offensive comment should not be removed without their approval.  Even further, I don’t think that companies should be reading through everyone’s messages, especially private messages, looking for evidence of cyberbullying.  One exception to this is online stalking.  If someone is registered as stalking someone, social media accounts should have special practices in place to purge anything related to the subject of stalking from the stalker’s accounts.  This can obviously be subverted with an extra account, but someone who is being stalked will hopefully not add random people without knowledge of who is behind the account. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, with respect to public figures, can this even be considered cyberbullying?  If someone is going online posting their opinion, they are fully aware that there will be people who disagree with them and want to verbally attack them.  It comes with the territory.  Would someone say that our president is being cyberbullied?  He receives arguably more hate and death threats than all of the figures of Gamergate combined.  However, the president accepts the responsibility of being publically judged and hated when they accept the position.  This is not new – before the internet, media viciously attacked public figures like politicians, MLK, musicians, and others.  Many leaders even had assassination attempts made on their lives.  When someone says that they want to kill Anita Sarkeesian, she should seek safety, allow investigation of the aggressing individual, and make sure that nothing happens.  However, to bloggers like Amanda Marcotte who complain about cyberbullying when people who dislike them tweet insults at them, like saying that Marcotte is a ‘perpetual victim’, “Grow up.  You are free to put your opinion out on the internet and people are free to tell you what they think of your opinion, accept your responsibility.” </p>
