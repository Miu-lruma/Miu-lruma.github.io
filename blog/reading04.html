		Reading 04: The Diversity Problem

		<p>&emsp;&emsp;In an ideal world, everyone would have the same opportunity and chance to have the same job, and in industries like the tech industry, there would be roughly the same number of employees of each race and gender.  However, in our world, there exist inequalities that currently make this goal unreachable.  In an article about the races of workers in the United States and the gender of the global workforce, the following numbers are quoted: </p>
		<div class="viice-center">

	</div>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;With respect to race, it can be seen that there are many more white and Asian people in the workforce of the United States than there are black and Hispanic people.  It can also be seen that Asian people are the only race over-represented in the tech industry, which was surprising to me.  It can also be noted that while there is 1% less white and black people in the tech industry, there are many less black people in the workforce as a whole, which makes this number much more significant.  Likewise, there is a large skew in leadership roles, with a much larger number of white people compared to the number of total people in the workforce.  This IS an issue.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think that this is how things should stay, I would argue that these numbers should drift so that the overall numbers are the same as the numbers in the other three columns; but, I would say that many people who are in favor of diversity are going about it the wrong way. </p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;I believe that if a company are to look at two applicants, with one being a better fit for the company, while the other one is a minority, choosing one individual solely for their skin color is a form of racism.  Rather than companies looking for black and Hispanic people in order to fill some sort of “quota”, the company should focus much more on making sure that the atmosphere at the office is friendly to those people, reprimanding anyone who harasses these employees and  giving everyone an equal chance to advance in the company.  Society as a whole should also transition into giving black and Hispanic people better opportunity to learn, become interested in tech, and prepare themselves for a career.  Similarly, I believe that women are under-represented in the workforce, but a company should not hire women in order to fulfill a “quota”, but because the women are skilled and right for the position, and enforce stronger office regulations regarding women and harassment. </p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Two additional comments that I have that only relate to gender are: first, the global numbers are very skewed, as in many foreign countries women are denied basic rights, education, and jobs.  This is a VERY serious issue that needs to be addressed, but as the focus of this reading is more on American companies, this is a discussion for another day.  Second, as discussed in articles relating to James Damore and Google, part of the reason for the gender gap in the tech industry is the differing desires of men and women.  I believe that everyone should be equal and that everyone should be allowed to pursue what they want.  I approve of organizations that encourage women to go into STEM fields, but I also think that women should not be forced into the tech industry or be told that only STEM jobs are worthwhile jobs in order to increase the ratio.  Everyone should be allowed to pursue whatever career they want. </p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To wrap up, I’ll mention some brief thoughts on the Uber article.  One of the main takeaways from the article is that Fowler was sexually harassed at Uber, and nothing was done about it.  This is exactly what I argue CAN be done by companies.  I don’t believe that the company should be obligated to hire more women to increase a ratio, but I do think that the company has a duty to stop sexual harassment and other discrimination in the workplace.  While my stance on diversity and hiring may be controversial, in my mind there is no place for harassment or discrimination in any workplace, and this is where companies should be required to do something for women.  If something is reported, investigate immediately and take harsh but appropriate action. </p>
