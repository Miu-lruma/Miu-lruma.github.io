		Reading 09: The Neutral Net
	</div>
	<div class="viice-content viice-container" id="about">
		<p class="viice-center"></p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Net neutrality is a topic that I have heard a lot about over the past year or so.  I spend a lot of time on the Internet, and there are countless posts, websites, etc. promoting net neutrality, and encouraging the user to fight for it, signing petitions, and other acts that probably won’t actually do anything.  Because of the amount I use the Internet, I love net neutrality, and I wouldn’t want it to go anywhere.  However, I support it for selfish reasons. I signed the petition – I wouldn’t want to pay any more for what I already have – I don’t think that I would say that the repeal of net neutrality is unethical.  Just like other subscription services, TV providers, phone providers, even certain software providers, you have to pay more for better services or packages.  The companies are allowed to do this, as they deliver a service to you, you are using their wires, their systems, their machines.  You have the freedom to choose a smaller package, another company has the freedom to come up with a flat-rate, no package deal, that would be very attractive to customers. Why is the Internet so much different?   The only thing that I can think of that is essentially free is radio, and even that is starting to be monetized through packages in the form of satellite radio!  In addition, regular radio is transmitted through the air.  If there was a company delivering the radio to you, like with satellite radio, they would definitely be charging in subscription packages, as well.  The radio stations that are sending out the radio signal over the air are making their money through advertisements.  It may be theoretically possible, not that I want any brilliant executives to get the idea, to offer internet where you must watch a 5 minute ad before you connect every time.  I could easily see this becoming the norm at places like McDonald’s that offer their Wi-Fi to customers. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;While I’m in favor of net neutrality, I don’t know if I can say that restricting companies from subscription packages in this industry, but not in any of the others is ethical.  The Internet is not a public service – you must go through the machines of many companies to reach your destination each time you go to Google.com.  It’s man-made, and someone has to provide the information to you – the government cannot *force* anyone to be the designated “internet guy” that has to provide the Internet as a public service to everyone.  To an extent, I trust in the free market to regulate itself, with a company offering internet without packages being favored by customers than one with packages, forcing the company with packages to keep up or develop something that customers like more than net neutrality.  When I don’t trust in the free market is when collusion starts to happen.  When companies work together, whether being bought out, or just fixing prices/strategies, the companies can greatly inflate their prices, because the consumer has no other option.  This is when the government really steps in to play, enforcing anti-trust laws and stopping unfair cooperation of companies. </p>
