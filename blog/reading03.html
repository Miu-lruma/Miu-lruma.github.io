		<p>&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned by Max Schireson, it is very socially acceptable for a man to have a demanding job, spend most of his time away from his family, and miss out on a lot of his child’s growth.  In contrast, Schireson mentioned several female CEOs who are constantly asked about their ability to manage their parental responsibilities while still maintaining their demanding job.  While this is the case, I think it is possible for both men and women to have a fulfilling job while still managing their family life.  Two of my very good childhood friends had stay-at-home dads, who cooked and managed the family while their wives worked substantial jobs.  While society at large may question these people, it is far from impossible for a woman to have just as much as her husband could in terms of a job-family balance.  However, while its possible, it is not easy for anyone to balance a demanding job with family life.  In some cases the husband, like Schireson, in some cases the wife, and in some cases both parents have such demanding jobs with lots of travel that they are away from their families for large amounts of time regularly.  This is challenging for anyone, regardless of gender, as Schireson discovered. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;While this may not be viable for many companies, I know that Google allows employees one afternoon per week to ignore their work and instead work on personal projects or cool down.  The company that I am interning with this upcoming summer, Epic Systems allows their employees to spend a month of paid sabbatical every five years, covering all expenses.  While these are spaced out, the paid vacation time is very helpful for employees to relax and not get burned out. </p>
		<p>&emsp;&emsp;Getting burned out is definitely detrimental to hard-working employees and to people in general.  I have dealt with getting burned out a few times during my life, generally near the end of semesters at school when a lot of my time is being taken up by studies and projects.  With or without school, when you have many groups of friends, it can commonly occur when all of them want to spend time with you, and ou end up not spending significant time with any of them.  This is similar to getting burned out from work, if you are balancing a job, schoolwork, friends, clubs, sleep, etc., it’s easy to start giving a little to each, but not a lot to all of them.  When school takes over my life at times, I neglect the rest to an extent.  This is not good for relationships, I start to lose interest in clubs and hobbies, and it could result in losing a job or doing bad on assignments if it gets bad enough.  In my case, it is important to overcome this part of being burned out.  With relationships, it’s important to tell the other person what you are busy with, and make sure that they know that you currently don’t have the time to spend with them; most people will understand.  It’s harder with obligations, but you need to develop a schedule, stick to it, and take care of the most important stuff, like schoolwork, first. </p>
